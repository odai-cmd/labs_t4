🔐 Password Security Basics

This project explains how passwords are stored, analyzed, and attacked, and why strong authentication is essential for security.

⸻

📌 What You’ll Learn
	•	Hashing vs Encryption
Passwords are stored as hashes, not plain text. Hashing is one-way and secure.
	•	Common Hash Types
	•	MD5 (weak)
	•	SHA-1 (weak)
	•	bcrypt (strong, recommended)
	•	Generating Hashes
Learn to create MD5, SHA-1, and bcrypt password hashes.
	•	Cracking Weak Passwords
Demonstrates dictionary and brute-force attacks using John the Ripper.
	•	Why Weak Passwords Fail
Short, common, and predictable passwords are cracked quickly.
	•	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA protects accounts even if passwords are compromised.

⸻

✅ Best Practices
	•	Use bcrypt or Argon2
	•	Password length 12+ characters
	•	Use mixed characters
	•	Enable MFA
	•	Avoid common passwords
	•	Use password managers
